Version 0.7.2 makes the plugin better at finding your `PATH` environment
variable. If you have changed the "exectuable" setting to work around not finding
`node` or `importjs`, you might be able to remove that workaround now.

As always, you should also update the import-js binary by running
`npm install -g import-js`

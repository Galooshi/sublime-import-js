Version 1.0.0 contains some good performance improvements, mainly by running
ImportJS in a background thread. To continue using the plugin, you need to
update to the latest version of the import-js npm package:

  npm install import-js -g

For even better performance, ImportJS integrates with Watchman. The watchman
dependency is optional. If you have it installed, ImportJS will utilize it. To
install Watchman, follow instructions here:

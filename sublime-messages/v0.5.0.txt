Starting with version 0.5.0, imports are now split into groups. Package
dependencies come first, followed by one or more groups containing "internal"
imports. It will look something like this:

  import React from 'react';
  import { debounce } from 'underscore';

  import Button from 'components/Button'
  import Icon from 'components/Icon';

To prepare your codebase for the change in one sweep, you can run the following
command:

find ./app -name "**.js" -exec import-js {} --overwrite --rewrite \;

You will need to adapt it to fit your project. And please note that this command
is destructive - it will overwrite all files matched by the `find` pattern.

Thanks for installing ImportJS! Before you can start using the plugin, you also
need to install the `importjs` binary.

   `npm install import-js -g`

You also might have to configure import-js

   See https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js for more information

4. Open the root of your project as a folder (Project -> Add Folder to Projectâ€¦)

When you are done with that, it's time to start importing files! Whenever you
have undefined variables, open the Command Palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P/CMD+SHIFT+P)
and select "ImportJS: fix all imports", or "ImportJS: import word under cursor".

It will be helpful to bind `import_js` to easy-to-use bindings, such as:

```
{ "keys": ["super+alt+i"], "command": "import_js", "args": { "command": "fix" } },
{ "keys": ["super+alt+j"], "command": "import_js", "args": { "command": "word" } },
{ "keys": ["super+alt+g"], "command": "import_js", "args": { "command": "goto" } },
```
